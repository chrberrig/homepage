			Software Projects
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have a few small software projects that I am working on. 
			Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, 
			but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, 
			they are welcome to do so :) <br>
			I currently have a github page, where you can access my code, 
			which is (in accordance with my views on free software) licensed under GPL.
			My plan is to eventually move my projects to a remote repo 
			that isn't owned by Microsoft, 
			or any of the other digital enslavement organizations.

		<h3>
			Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy
		</h3>
		<p>
			I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. 
			I am a member of the currently functioning society for free software in 
			Denmark "Fri software netv√¶rk" 
				(that ironically don't have a website yet, 
				even though we have existed since 2019, 
				which I find embarrassing; please get it moving guys!)
			that is independent of both FSF and EFF, 
			but pretty aligned in their causes. <br>
			My function in this society so far have been in outreach and communication, 
			which I enjoy. 
			This have in particular been focusing on high-school students 
			as an awareness campaign 
				(its hard for anyone to engage in causes you are not aware of), 
				and hopefully a few individuals have been democratically awakened. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe 
				(I don't try to preach, 
				you are totally entitled to your own opinion, man), 
			that the current way of how the web functions, 
			is somewhere in-between economically and democratically unsustainable, 
			to problematic.
			The way platforms in particular incentivise people to become 
			dependent of their "services", 
			and the role social media have taken as a form of privatized public space 
			in digital format, 
			is from my point of view currently enslaving its users in the digital space.
			Thus, I dub the far majority of the large 
			tech-companies "Digital enslavement organizations".
