	<h2>Rants</h2>
	<p>
		Also, I have some records of <a href="rants.html">ramblings and rants</a>, 
		regarding e.g. the structure of society, economy, free software, 
		and other random subjects that belongs in the tangent space of my interests.

	<h2>Interests and hobbies:</h2>
	<p>
		I Enjoy tinkering with computers and reading.
		My latest interests include the ethical, technical and legislative battles faught in regards to the digital space, public goods and economic distribution/equality.
	</p>

	<h3>Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy</h3>
	<p>
		I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. 
		I am a member of the currently functioning society for free software in Denmark "Fri software netv√¶rk". 
		This is a sociecy independent of both <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, but pretty aligned in their causes.
		My function in this society so far have been in outreach and communication, but this is mainly due to me going rougue in order to get anything done at all. :)

	<h3>This is my online presence!</h3>
	<p>
		There are many reasons to make a website. 
		Mine are, that I would like to maximize personal independence when it concerns the digital space. 
		I aim to do so while also in sevaral different ways:
		<ul>
			<li> Using code that is licenced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft licences</a> </li>
			<li> Minimizing the code base I use that allows this high degree of independence.  </li>
		</ul> 
		Social media platforms 
		<!--(with a <a href="free_software.html">few exceptions</a>) -->
		are therefore quite undesirable to me, since these not only discourage, 
		but also disallow digital independence. 
		<!--At the same time, most of such "servises" performs 
		<a href="">defacto low-grade mind-control</a>.
		Thus I dub these 
		<a href="free_software.html">digital enslavement services</a> -->
		The personal website is an awesome alternative, 
		that also provides you with a chance to get a little 
		insight in the technicalities of how the web works, 
		and why <a href="https://suckless.org/sucks/web/">most of the web is currently broken</a>.
