	<p>
		My name is Christian Berrig, 
		M.Sc from University of Copenhagen in Physics 
		and Ph.D. Student at RUC in mathematical modelling of disease spead. 
		I Enjoy tinkering with computers and reading.
		My latest interests include the ethical, technical and legislative battles 
		faught in regards to the digital space, 
		public goods and economic distribution/equality.
		Everything available though my website is free to use and redistribute 
		for only non-commercial purposes.
	</p>
	<h2>
		This is my online presence!
	</h2>
	<p>
		There are many reasons to make a website. 
		Mine are, that I would like to maximize personal independence 
		when it concerns the digital space. 
		I pursit to do so while also minimizing the code base 
		that allows this high degree of independence.
		Social media platforms 
		<!--(with a <a href="free_software.html">few exceptions</a>) -->
		are therefore quite undesirable to me, since these not only discourage, 
		but also disallow digital independence. 
		<!--At the same time, most of such "servises" performs 
		<a href="">defacto low-grade mind-control</a>.
		Thus I dub these 
		<a href="free_software.html">digital enslavement services</a> -->
		The personal website is an awesome alternative, 
		that also provides you with a chance to get a little 
		insight in the technicalities of how the web works, 
		and why <a href="https://suckless.org/sucks/web/">most of the web is currently broken</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Rants</h2>
	<p>
		Also, I have some records of <a href="rants.html">ramblings and rants</a>, 
		regarding e.g. the structure of society, economy, free software, 
		and other random subjects that belongs in the tangent space of my interests.

	<h2>
		<a href="/academia/index.html">Academia</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		I have both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in physics 
		from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
		After a year as a teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, 
		I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
		<!--At some point, write about the years at DTU, 
		how it was unlikeable and why is was a dead end academically!-->
		I am currently studying at RUC doing mathematical modelling and simulations 
		regarding heterogenous structures of epidemiological systems.
		My focus in regards to mathematical modelling is particularly networks, 
		epidemiology, and spread of human diseases. <br>
		To read about my academic life, work, publications 
		etc. <a href="/academia/index.html">here</a>.
		<!--An issue within the world of academia that have caught my 
		interest of late, 
		is the system regarding the incentive structure and economc insentives 
		of scientific publications. 
		More on that can be found in the collection of 
		<a href="rants.html">rants</a>.-->

	<h3>
		Notes
	</h3>
	<p>
		I have written, and still writes, notes regarding subjects, 
		that are of interest to me.
		This is some curated <a href="/text/notes/index.html">notes</a> on Mathematics, 
		Physics, Epidemiology and Programming.

		Interests and hobbies:
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy
	</h3>
	<p>
		I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. 
		I am a member of the currently functioning society for free software in 
		Denmark "Fri software netværk" that is independent of both 
		<a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> 
		and 
		<a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>,
		but pretty aligned in their causes. <br>
		My function in this society so far have been in outreach and communication.

		<a href="/software/index.html">Software</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		I have a few small software projects that I am working on. 
		Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, 
		but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, 
		they are welcome to do so :) 
		<!--

		I currently have a github page, where you can access my code, 
		which is (in accordance with my views on free software) licensed under GPL.
		My plan is to eventually move my projects to a remote repo 
		that isn't owned by Microsoft, 
		or any of the other digital enslavement organizations.
