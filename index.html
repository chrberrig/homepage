		<h2>
			This is my online presence!
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are many reasons to make a website. 
			Mine are, that I would like to maximize personal independence when it concerns the digital space. 
			<!--	
			Thus <a href="free_software.html">digital enslavement services</a> 
			and social media platforms (with a <a href="free_software.html">few exceptions</a>) 
			are quite undesirable to me. 
			The personal website is an amazing alternative, even though it is not exactly fashionable, 
			that also provides you with a chance to get a little insight in how the web works.
			-->
		</p>
		<!--
		<h2>Rants</h2>
		<p>
			Also, I have some records of <a href="rants.html">ramblings and rants</a>, 
			regarding e.g. the structure of society, economy, free software, 
			and other random subjects that belongs in the tangent space of my interests.

		<h2>
			Notes
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have written, and still writes, notes regarding some subjects, that are of interest to me.
			This is some curated <a href="notes_index.html">notes</a> on Mathematics, Physics, Epidemiology and Programming.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Academia
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
			After a year as a teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
			<!--At some point, write about the years at DTU, how it was unlikeable and why is was a dead end academically!-->
			I am currently working at RUC as scientific assistant doing mathematical modelling, 
				in particular with respect to epidemiology and spread of human diseases. <br>
			An issue within the world of academia that have caught my interest of late, 
				is the system regarding the incentive structure and economy of scientific publications. 
			To read about my academic life, work, publications etc. <a href="academia_index.html">here</a>.

		<h2>
			Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. 
			I am a member of the currently functioning society of "Fri software netværk" 
				(that ironically don't have a website yet, even though we have existed for a whole year, which I find embarrassing)
				that is independent of both FSF and EFF, but pretty aligned in their causes. <br>
			My function In this society so far have been in outreach and communication, which I enjoy. 
			This have in particular been focusing on high-school students as an awareness campaign 
				(its hard for anyone to engage in causes you are not aware of), 
				and hopefully a few individuals have been democratically awakened. 
		</p>
		<img src="imgs_webbase/svg/frame-delete.svg" class="centericon"/>
		<p>
			I believe(and thus I don't try to preach, you are totally entitled to your own opinion, man), 
				that the current way of how the web functions is somewhere in-between economically and democratically unsustainable to problematic.
			The way platforms in particular incentivise people to become dependent of their "services", 
				and the role social media have taken as a form of privatized public space in digital format, 
				is from my point of view currently enslaving its users in the digital space.
			Thus, I dub the far majority of the large tech-companies "Digital enslavement organizations".
			More on this can be read here...

		<h2>
			Software
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have a few small software projects that I am working on. 
			Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, 
				but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, they are welcome to do so :) <br>
			I currently have a github page, where you can access my code, 
				which is (in accordance with my views on free software)
				licensed under GPL.
			My plan is to eventually move my projects to a remote repo that isn't owned by Microsoft, or any of the other digital enslavement organizations.
