			I have both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
			After a year as a teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
			I am currently working at RUC as scientific assistant doing mathematical modelling,
			in particular with respect to epidemiology and spread of human diseases. <br>
			An issue within the world of academia that have caught my interest of late,
			is the system regarding the incentive structure and economy of scientific publications.
			<!--
			At some point, write about the years at DTU, how and why it was unlikeable and why is was a dead end academically!

			The notes that exists on this site, are notes written primarily for my own sake, partially as an exercise in checking that I have actually understood a subject, partially to save and communicate this knowledge.

			Publications
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics,
			and since I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information,
			much of the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential to quantum theory.
			Since my focus recently changed to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases,
			much of recent education in mathematics have been characterized of applied mathematics.
			I have compiled a list of my publications <a href="publications_index.html">here</a>.

			Physics
		</h2>
		<p>
			I received a masters degree in physics from University of Copenhagen in 2017. 
			<!--
			There is not much else to say about that. 
			That is of cause untrue, but most of what I have to say about my masters degree is not flattering, so I will not. 
			It was the cause of a long period with low self-esteem and depressive periods that I still fight with, 
			though I am much better than I were in that regard a few years ago.

		 	Matematikcenter

		<p>
			I have been a volunteer at Matematikcenter, 
			a non-profit organization for homework-help and teaching in mathematics targeted at high-school students.
			In that process, I have recorded some 30-ish videos, that can be viewed on 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Et2H2140L8cNaT4XPgnrQ">Matematikcenters channel</a>.
