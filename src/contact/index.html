For anyone interested, I can recommend using protonail for enhanced online privacy, 
since it is automatically end-to-end encrypted when writing to another to another protonmail 
(given of cause that you trust the server-side of protonmail, otherwise not much is gained).<br>
However, it suffers from the same weakness as all other encryption schemes, 
namely that the encryption is only as strong as the weakest party(encryption-wise) in the communication. <br>
So make sure to practice safe encrypted communication out there, 
and put on your GPG-encryption before you mail with all the beautiful people.
That way, we all stay safe while having fun on the interwebs :)
