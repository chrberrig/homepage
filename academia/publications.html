		videnskab.dk: "Britisk variant lurer stadig: Denne interaktive beregner viser, hvorfor vi er n√∏dt til at holde fast"
	</h3>
	<p>
		A piece on the B.1.1.7 variant and the effects of the introduction of this variant on infectivity and contact number. 
		The full article should be available <a href="https://videnskab.dk/forskerzonen/naturvidenskab/britisk-variant-lurer-stadig-denne-interaktive-beregner-viser-hvorfor-vi-er-noedt-til">here</a>
		Finally, there is an appendix that might be interesting for high-schoolers (or anyone else interested) to serve as an example and the application of the logistic equation. 
		It is available as a link in the article text as a pdf doc.
