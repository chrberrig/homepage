			Education
		</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
			After a year as a physics and math teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, 
			I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
			I am currently at RUC as PhD student, doing mathematical modelling,
			in particular with respect to epidemiology and disease modelling. <br>
			<!--
			As it turns out, nothing like a global pandemic makes this this subject popular as never before!
			An issue within the world of academia that have caught my interest of late,
			is the system regarding the incentive structure and economy of scientific publications.
			More on that can be found in the collection of <a href="rants.html">rants</a>.
			At some point, write about the years at DTU, how and why it was unlikeable and why is was a dead end academically!

			You can find my ORCID <a href="/contact/index.html">here</a> 
			<!-- or <a href="publications_index.html">here</a> -->
			if you want.

		<h2>
			Publications
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics,
			and since I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information,
			much of the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential to quantum theory.
			Since my focus recently changed to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases,
			much of recent education in mathematics have been characterized of applied mathematics.
			I have compiled a list of <a href="publications.html">my publications</a>, that I maintain.

			Notes

		<p>
			The notes that exists on this site, are notes written primarily for my own sake, 
			partially as an exercise in checking that I have actually understood a subject, 
			partially to save and communicate this knowledge. 
			The notes I have written, are primarily for my own sake. 
			You are free to use these notes for any non-commercial use you see fit, 
			and may share them freely, again under the restriction that it is for non-commercial use only.

			Physics
		</h2>
		<p>
			I received a masters degree in physics from University of Copenhagen in 2017. 
			<!--
			There is not much else to say about that. 
			That is of course untrue, but most of what I have to say about my masters degree is not flattering, so I will not. 
			It was the cause of a long period with low self-esteem and depressive periods that I still fight with, 
			though I am much better than I were in that regard a few years ago.

			<a href="/academia/epidemiology.html">Epidemiology and disease modeling</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			In may 2020, during the first months of lockdown in Denmark due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
			I became scientific assistant at RUC, under Viggo Andreasen and Lone Simonsen. 
			By November 2020, I became a PhD student under Viggo Andreasen to investigate 
			"The impact of heterogeneity on the transmission dynamics of epidemic diseases"
			in the research group PandemiX at RUC.
			I have as well as studying this very broad subject, also assisted and participating in writing reports to SSI for further assessment, 
			as a part of the <a href=https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center>PandemiX group.</a>
			Some of these reports can be seen under <a href="publications.html">my publications</a>

		 	Outreach
		</h2>
		<p>
			I have also done quite a bit in science communication and outreach, both in regard to mathematics and physics.

		 	Matematikcenter
		</h3>
		<p>
			I have been a volunteer at Matematikcenter, 
			a non-profit organization for homework-help and teaching in mathematics targeted at high-school students.
			In that process, I have recorded some 30-ish videos, that can be viewed on 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Et2H2140L8cNaT4XPgnrQ">Matematikcenters channel</a>.
