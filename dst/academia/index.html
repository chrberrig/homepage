<h1>Academia</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
	I have my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
	After a year as a physics and math teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
	I am currently a Ph.D. student in the <a href=https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center>PandemiX group.</a> at RUC, doing mathematical modelling of evolution and dynamics of infectious diseases. <br>
	You can find my ORCID <a href="/contact/index.html">here</a>.
</p>


<h2><a href="publications.html">Publications</a></h2>
<p>
	I have compiled a list of <a href="publications.html">my publications</a>, that I maintain.
</p>


<h2><a href="/text/notes/index.html">Notes</a></h2>
<p>
	The notes that exists on this site, are notes written primarily for my own sake. 
	In this way, I can check that I have actually understood a subject, while saving and communicating this knowledge. 
	You are free to use these notes for any non-commercial use you see fit.
	My notes on are accessible <a href="/text/notes/index.html">here</a>.
</p>


<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>
	I have studied mathematics alongside my education in physics, 
	and since I originally aspired to work in theoretical quantum information, 
	much of the mathematics I picked up along the way, is tangential to quantum theory. 
	Since my focus changed to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, 
	much of recent education in mathematics have been characterized by applied mathematics, graph theory, adaptive dynamics, complex and stochasic modelling, and dynamical systems. 
</p>


<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>
	I received a masters degree in physics from University of Copenhagen in 2017. 
	<!--
	There is not much else to say about that. 
	That is of course untrue, but most of what I have to say about my masters degree is not flattering, so I will not. 
	It was the cause of a long period with low self-esteem and depressive periods that I still fight with, 
	though I am much better than I were in that regard a few years ago. 
	-->
</p>


<h2><a href="/academia/epidemiology.html">Epidemiology and disease modelling</a></h2>
<p>
	In may 2020, during the first months of lockdown in Denmark due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
	I became scientific assistant at RUC, under Viggo Andreasen and Lone Simonsen. 
	By November 2020, I became a PhD student under Viggo Andreasen to investigate 
	"The impact of heterogeneity on the transmission dynamics of epidemic diseases"
	in the research group PandemiX at RUC.
	I have as well as studying this very broad subject, also assisted and participating in writing reports to SSI for further assessment, 
	as a part of the <a href=https://ruc.dk/research-centre/pandemix-center>PandemiX group.</a>
	Some of these reports can be seen under <a href="publications.html">my publications</a>
</p>


<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
	Through my education in physics, not much programming were (surprisingly) needed.
	After I were actually in an environment in which I needed to APPLY knowledge (shocks!) to disease modelling, 
	I have become much more comfortable both with programming and computers. 
	<!--
	A large part of this is due to a dear friend and former colleague of mine from my DTU-years, 
	who have learned me more about computers than all my years in the academic system managed to do.
	-->
	Beside the now over 10-ish years I have with Python and \LaTeX that (almost) every physicist eventually will acquire, 
	I have also now, during the last 5-ish years, dipped my toes in C, C++. 
	Git and Ansible, with which I am also familiarizing myself, are not programming languages, 
	but tools for version-control and automation respectively, which are indispensable for programming.
	HTML do not count as programming (and neither do \LaTeX, but for some reason it seems like a lot of people find \LaTeX much more difficult than HTML).
	You are of course welcome to check out some of my projects on my repository <a href="https://github.com/chrberrig">here</a>, but i warn you; Its an unholy mess!
</p>


<h2>Outreach</h2>
<p>
	I have also done quite a bit in science communication and outreach, both in regard to mathematics and physics.
</p>

<h3>Copenhagen Science Slam</h3>
<p>
	Like poetry slam, but with short science-talks. 
	I won in 2011, with the special theory of relativity, and after that assisted in arranging a couple of science slams.
</p>

<h3>Matematikcenter</h3>
<p>
	I have been a volunteer at Matematikcenter, 
	a non-profit organization for homework-help and teaching in mathematics targeted at high-school students.
	In that process, I have recorded some 30-ish videos, that can be viewed on 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Et2H2140L8cNaT4XPgnrQ">Matematikcenters channel</a>.
