<h1>Software</h1>

<h2>Software Projects</h2>
<p>
	I have a few small software projects that I am working on. 
	Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, they are welcome to do so :) <br>
	I currently have a <a href=https://github.com/chrberrig>github</a> page, where you can access my code, which is (in accordance with my views on free software) licensed under GPL.
	My plan is to eventually move my projects to a remote repo that is not economically dependent on Micro$oft, or any of the other digital enslavement organizations.
</p>

<h3>Free software, privacy, digital slavery, and democracy</h3>
<p>
	I have become fairly involved in the cause of Free software. 
	I am a member of the currently functioning society for free software in Denmark "Fri software netv√¶rk" 
		<!--(that ironically don't have a website yet, even though we have existed since 2019, which I find embarrassing; please get it moving guys!)-->
	that is independent of both <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, but pretty aligned in their causes. <br>
	My function in this society so far have been in outreach and communication, which I enjoy. 
	This have in particular been focusing on high-school students as an awareness campaign. 
</p>
<p>
	I believe (I don't try to preach, you are totally entitled to your own opinion, man), that the current way of how the web functions, is somewhere in-between economically and democratically unsustainable, to problematic.
	The way platforms in particular incentivise people to become dependent of their "services". 
	The role social media have taken as a form of privatized public space in digital format, is from my point of view currently enslaving its users in the digital space.
	Thus, I dub the far majority of the large tech-companies "Digital enslavement organizations".
