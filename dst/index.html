<h1>Christian Berrig</h1>

<h2>whoami</h2>
<p>
	My name is Christian Berrig. <br> 
	I have a M.Sc in physics from University of Copenhagen. <br>
	I am now a Ph.D. Student at RUC, doing mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. <br>
</p>



<h2><a href="/academia/index.html">Academia</a></h2>
<p>
	I have both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in physics from the University of Copenhagen. <br>
	After a year as a teacher at Slagelse Gymnasium, I decided to go back to Academia. <br>
	I am currently studying at RUC doing mathematical modelling and simulations regarding heterogenous structures of epidemiological systems.
	<!--
	My focus in regards to mathematical modelling is particularly networks, epidemiology, and spread of human diseases. <br>
	To read about my academic life, work, publications 
	etc. click <a href="/academia/index.html">here</a>.

</p>

<h3><a href="/text/notes/index.html">Notes</a></h3>
<p>
	I have written, and still writes, notes regarding subjects, that interests me.
	These <a href="/text/notes/index.html">notes</a> are primarily on Mathematics, Physics, Epidemiology and Programming.
</p>

<h2><a href="/software/index.html">Software</a></h2>
<p>
	I have a few small software projects that I am working on. 
	Mostly it is for my own sake to keep in shape in regards to programming, but if anyone would like to benefit from what I have done so far, they are welcome to do so :) <br>
	I currently have a github, where you can access my code, which is (in accordance with my views on free software) licensed under a copyleft licence.
	Eventually I will move my projects to a remote repo that isn't in economically dependent on M$.
