		<p>
		For anyone interested, i can recommend protonail for enhanced online privacy, 
		since it is automatically end-to-end encrypted when writing to another to another protonmail. <br>
		However, it suffers from the same weakness as all other encryption schemes, 
		namely that the encryption is only as strong as the weakest party(encryption-wise) in the communication. <br>
		So make sure to practice safe encrypted communication out there, and put on your GPG-encryption before you mail with all the beautiful people :)
